## üöÄ&nbsp; Introduction

**Proxmox VE Helper-Scripts** is a community-driven initiative that simplifies the setup of Proxmox Virtual Environment (VE).

- **Interactive Setup**: Select simple or advanced options for your VM or LXC container configurations.
- **Customizable Configuration**: Advanced setup allows you to fine-tune your environment.
- **Ease of Use**: Scripts automatically validate inputs to generate the final configuration.
- **Proxmox Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Proxmox VE to provide a user-friendly experience.
- **Community-Driven**: This project is actively maintained and improved by the community.
